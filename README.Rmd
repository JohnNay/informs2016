# Machine Learning for Public Policy

A Session in the Artificial Intelligence Cluster of the INFORMS Annual Meeting. This year the meeting is in Nashville Nov 13-16 and there are expected to be more than 5,000 attendees. Here is the 2016 Annual Meeting Website: [http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/nashville2016/](http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/nashville2016/). 

This session will feature research presentations on data-driven machine learning approaches to predicting and improving policy. For example, one of the presentations is on an agent-based model of solar panel adoption trained on household-level data and another is on forecasting the enactment of Congressional bills.
