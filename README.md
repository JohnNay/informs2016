Machine Learning for Public Policy
==================================

A Session in the Artificial Intelligence Cluster of the INFORMS Annual Meeting. This year the meeting is in Nashville Nov 13-16 and there are expected to be more than 5,000 attendees. Here is the 2016 Annual Meeting Website: <http://meetings2.informs.org/wordpress/nashville2016/>.

This session will feature presentations on data-driven machine learning approaches to understanding, predicting and improving public policy. For example, presentations describe the application of machine learning to extracting simple rules for prison release decisions from complex data-driven models, designing environmental sustainability policy, and natural language processing to predict law-making.
